# Student Record System
## Introduction:-
Student Record Management System (SRS), sometimes also referred to as Student Information System (SIS), Student Management System (SMS), or Student Information Management System (SIMS) – is a software solution for tracking and managing student data. 

SRS is specifically designed for educational settings, and its many features enable school’s efficient functioning on a daily basis. 

 

In essence, it gathers all the valuable student-related information on a single platform, enables quick retrieval of essential data, and filters their availability by the access level. 

 

In other words, it’s a modern-day, digitized version of piling files in drawers. Except that the modernized enhancement comes with many additional features, such as quick data scanning, report generation, and data networking.

 

Complicated terms aside, a well-crafted Student Record Management System quickly became a trustworthy partner that helps educational institutions make informed decisions, boost their enrollment rates, and operate smoothly from day to day. 

 ## Objective of Project:-
 The primary function of the Student Record Management System is to replace a complex net of educational bureaucracy and provide efficient communication channels on all levels: between educational leaders, policymakers, separate departments within an institution – all the way to administrators, students, and their parents.

 

Like any information system, its aim is to solve problems by storing data, extracting information, and using it to improve knowledge. 

 

In pragmatic terms, this means that a well-designed Student Record Management System will:


* Store and safeguard student information
* Keep record of classroom-related activities, such as attendance, performance, behavior
* Organize documents
* Enhance library management
* Manage the admission process
* Handle tuition and fees payments
* Identify trends through reporting features
* Alleviate the inter-department communication 
 ## Benifits:-
 #1: Paperless System For Digitization Of Work
 * The first & foremost benefit of a student record management system is that it is a paperless system!

* It digitizes the complete procedure of compiling, accessing, analyzing & saving student information.

* As an educator or administrative faculty member, you don’t need to maintain piles of files anymore. Just integrate the education ERP system with the student information system and you are sorted.

* Zero paper hassles equal a lot of cost savings as well as money savings.

* Great, ain’t it?
#2: Centralized Platform For Record Management
* An educational institution with multiple branches or the one that’s a part of MAT (Multi-Academy Trust) needs to be extra careful when it comes to student record management.

* Either you belong to MAT or an individual institution with multiple courses & programs, the student information management system helps you -

* Keep the data at a centralized location
* Give role-based access
* 24*7 access
* OTP & password encryption
* In this way, any faculty member or higher authority of the institution can anytime check & extract the required student data at any given point in time.

* There’s no need to worry about finding old files & extracting data!

#3: Records From -Admission To Alumni Journey
* Right from admission to the point when students leave the organization and become alumni, institutions need to have their records.

* As an institution, the information could be helpful for you to contact the students during campus drive or organizing any event, right?

* Beyond this, you could also keep in touch with the students even after they graduate.

* Managing students’ records of 100s of batches –

-> Year-wise
-> Branch-wise
-> Section-wise
-> Course-wise
Everything becomes easier with an efficient student information management system.

#4: 100% Student Data Security
* Student data management is one aspect.

* Maintaining 100% student data security is another.

* An efficient student record management system must be able to provide you both!

## Define System:-
A student record management software is a tool that tracks and records regular activities of the students in institutes including attendance, exam performance, and their behavior. The software can be accessed by students, teachers, admin and parents with a role-based login. It collects all the student data along with their personal information which can be easily searched and retrieved later on. The software stores years of data online on a cloud platform.
## Explanation:-
Student records are often viewed as paperwork produced for the education bureaucracy. However, a well-designed student record system, whether using paper documents or automated systems, yields many benefits. The most important of these is the ability to report information for decision making about individual students, schools, programs, and school districts. A second benefit, particularly with automated systems, is efficiency in processing and exchanging student records among schools. When student records are added to an overall management information system that includes information on staff, materials, and budgeting for the school or school district, more management activities can be accomplished and efficiency will be improved. Student record systems, thus, play a key role in the overall functioning of the education system; but more importantly, they increase a school's ability to meet the needs of students.
## SWOT Analysis:-     
 You are more likely to succeed in a career if you are aware of your abilities and grab on to the opportunities as they emerge. There may be times when you would feel stuck at a limbo point in your life, whether it’s choosing the right stream in class 11 or choosing the best college and course after class 12, studying in India or studying abroad, etc. In these times, very few of you may be aware of your strengths and weaknesses and how they could affect the achievement of your career goals. Performing a SWOT Analysis of yourself helps in bringing clarity about how your personality traits fit your career aspirations.

## Strengths:-
 * Fast data  providing and availability were  identified among  the strengths of  UD MIS.  However, this requires smooth operation of the system and data loading without any mistakes.  
 * In order to specific and ad-hoc requests can be served by MIS, appropriately qualified workers are needed who proficient in MIS and source systems and who are able to recognise connections in the massive amounts of data sets and implement to prepare reports in the data warehouse.
 * Presenting statements is also one of the strengths, however, it presupposes that workers at MIS have the knowledge to present  management reports  and executive  summaries in an expected way, moreover, leaders also need a certain level of proficiency in using web reporting interface.  
## Weaknesses:-
 * Data purity is one of the main weak points of MIS system since data in data warehouse and reports generated from them are as reliable as data of source systems.
 * Source systems are utilised by many users who record data according to different principles and regulations and it imposes a burden on the MIS Centre to detect and standardize them.  
 * Another difficulty is the complexity of the system. So as the workers can apply it, high level BW skills are needed on the on hand, and on the other hand data modelling and other operational procedures can be attained by professionals as well through long learning process.
 * SAP typically offers such solutions for which it provides its own professionals on exceptional high price level which resulted a strong dependence on IT service providers. Inflexibility of reports is generally arisen from their complexity since the more complex the  topic  is,  the  harder  to  adapt  to  the  changes. 
 * Another  reason  for  it  the  slow  pace  of information flow,  because information  about the modifications  done in  the source  systems have to be known also by the operators of the data warehouse in order to set ups of MIS can be adapted to the source system. 
 ## Opportunities:-
  Management information systems still have significant potential in terms of their uses; the number of their application fields is unlimited. It may contribute to measure the attainment .
  ## 4W's And 1H:-
  4Ws stand for What, Why, When and  Where.  1H (or 2H) stands for How.

## What:
 Thinking of What initiates the process of understanding the basics of issue, problem or scenario at hand. It is about cognitive mapping of the scope of the issue, problem, or scenario.

 ## Why:
 Asking ‘Why’ entails clarifying why the issue, problem or situation at hand occurred. It aims to identify the triggers and rationalizes the occurrence of an issue or a problem.
 ## When:
  This element is about time-stamping the occurrence of an issue or a problem. Having an understanding of the time of occurrence could help in sequencing the triggers and impact of the issue, or problem.

## Where:
 This element is used to pinpoint the location or place of occurrence and hence could be helpful in identifying the people and other things present / existing at that location which may have contributed to the occurrence of an issue or problem.
 ## How: 
  This element of technique is used to examine the sequence of things and triggers and how the resultant problem or issue unfolded.
  ## Requirements:-
* Conduct a requirement specification from first principles that will be based around the genericrequirement of a typical university school
* An investigation of potential customers (university school)
* Business process modelling and information capture requirement
* Providing evidence of investigation
* At least one presentation for summarise requirement specificatio
